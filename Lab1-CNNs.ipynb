    "1. Be sure to **document** all of your decisions, as well as your intermediate and final results. Make sure your conclusions and analyses are clearly presented. Don't make us dig into your code or walls of printed results to try to draw conclusions from your code.\n",
    "2. If you use code from someone else (e.g. Github, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, etc) you **must be transparent about it**. Document your sources and explain how you adapted any partial solutions to creat **your** solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ I have provided some **starter** code at the beginning. **NONE** of this code should survive in your solutions. Not only is it **very** badly written, it is also written in my functional style that also obfuscates what it's doing (in part to **discourage** your reuse!). It's just to get you *started*.\n",
    "+ These exercises ask you to compare **multiple** training runs, so it is **really** important that you factor this into your **pipeline**. Using [Tensorboard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html) is a **very** good idea -- or, even better [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).\n",

    "#### Results\n",
    "For MNIST, a relatively simple dataset, shallow architectures (2 and 4 MLP blocks) achieve similarly good performance. In these cases, vanishing gradients are not noticeable, as confirmed by the gradient norms logged in WandB. However, architectures without skip connections still show slower convergence, suggesting that either mild gradient attenuation occurs or that skip connections provide additional architectural flexibility by allowing the network to partially bypass layers that are not contributing useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of skip connections becomes dramatic in the deeper 8-block architecture. Without skip connections, the network struggles to learn, likely due to severe vanishing gradients. Introducing skip connections enables effective gradient flow and allows the model to achieve good performance, demonstrating the importance of residual connections in facilitating training in deeper networks."
